            <br>Our Prediction of Employee Attrition of a Medical Supply/Pharmaceutical Company.
            <br>The models used in this platform in Random Forest Regressor with accuracy score around 98%.
            <br>In this project I am using Employee Database of an Indian Medical Supply/Pharmaceutical Company downloaded from Kaggle. 
            <br>This project goals is to predict employee attrition or in a simple explanation, predict the probability of an employee to resign/retire from their jobs. 
            <br>The main purpose is not to predict whether certain individual tends to leave or not.
            <br>instead we want to create a platform for better decision making in HR policy and management based on data regarding employee attrition.
